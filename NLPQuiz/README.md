# Project NLP-Quiz

The project contains 15 questions on the topic "Natural Language Processing", which are presented in the form of a test with 3 answer options.
On the main screen there is a window with a welcome message and a button to start the quiz.
One point is given for each correct answer and the final number of correct answers is displayed at the end. 
Wrong answers are highlighted in red and correct answers are highlighted in green.
All questions for this quiz are set in the class "Constants" in the form of a question set in the class "Question".
The Quiz Questions Activity class implements object-oriented programming and the main program.

The program can be improved by the chatbot for more interaction between Pepper and the person, however, during the implementation, I had a problem with noise due to which the robot stopped listening and responding to answers
