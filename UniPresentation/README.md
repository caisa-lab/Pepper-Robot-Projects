# Project Unipresentation 

The project presented in the form of presentations telling about the University of Marburg.
There are three buttons on the main window: "Marburg", "University", "Infrastructure".
By clicking on one of them, a presentation will start.
The slides on the screen of the robot were prepared in advance and added to the program in the form of images using the method "setImage()". The corresponding Text is added using the method "makeSay()".
The program returns to the main screen when the individual presentation is finished.

Ideas for improvement:
Animation or soundtracks may be added later. The methods required for this are added at the end of the code in the comments.
It could be added a chatbot for interactions with a person or program a reaction to different words.
